# Estecon

Welcome to the Estecon project! Estecon is a professional portfolio project focused on showcasing the services of an accounting firm based in Pedro II - PI. Below, you'll find the guidelines and standards that we follow during the development process.

## Standards and Best Practices

To maintain consistency and ensure the quality of our codebase, we follow the guidelines listed below:

### 1. Semantic Commits

We use semantic commits to provide meaningful information about the changes made in the codebase. Below are the common commit types:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation updates
- `style:` for formatting changes (no code changes)
- `refactor:` for code refactoring (neither fixes nor features)
- `perf:` for performance improvements
- `test:` for adding or updating tests
- `chore:` for maintenance and other tasks that don't affect the source code (e.g., updating build tasks, package manager configurations)
- `ci:` for CI/CD pipeline changes

Example commit message:

`git commit -a -m "feat: login form validation implemented."`


### 2. Use English for Documentation

English is the standard language for all documentation in Estecon. This includes:

- Code comments
- Readme files
- Inline documentation
- Variable and function names (where applicable)

Using English helps us reach a broader audience and makes it easier for contributors from around the world to participate.

### 3. Use Semantic Tags

Semantic HTML tags enhance the accessibility, SEO, and readability of the application. Make sure to use tags that describe the content accurately:

- Use `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and other semantic tags instead of generic `<div>` and `<span>` where applicable.
- Proper use of `<main>` to denote the main content of the document.
- `<aside>` for complementary content, such as sidebars.

This practice improves the structure and usability of the application and makes the code more readable for other developers.
